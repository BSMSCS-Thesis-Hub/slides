## 2. Research Problem & Questions

### Problem Statement

Integrating compression techniques into Federated Distillation (FD) reduces communication and computation overhead, but introduces a severe "Compression-Utility Trade-off" in non-IID (heterogeneous) data settings. Current static baseline methods (e.g., Compressed Federated Distillation - CFD) apply fixed quantization, causing significant information loss and degrading model performance on complex or high-dimensional feature spaces.

Conversely, state-of-the-art dynamic compression algorithms (like DynFed) base their adaptive triggers heavily on hardware resources. In smart healthcare / medical wearables, this creates a critical blind spot: if a wearable device has low memory but captures highly complex, skewed data (e.g., sudden erratic movements or a fall), resource-aware algorithms will blindly over-compress the updates, destroying life-critical motion features. The proposed solution is a hybrid "data- and resource-aware" adaptive quantization framework, which uses hardware constraints to bound the maximum bit-width and client-side data complexity to optimize the final compression rate.

### Core Research Questions (RQs)

1. **RQ1**: How can we quantify the non-IID complexity of selected Healthcare IoT datasets to inform the data-aware aspect of the adaptive compression mechanism?
2. **RQ2**: How can we design a hybrid dynamic quantization algorithm that minimizes communication and computational overhead by bounding maximum compression bit-widths to device resource constraints, while preserving activity recognition accuracy by optimizing the final bit-width according to the measured data heterogeneity?
